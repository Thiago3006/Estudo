## Proposal 

Make a program to read an integer N and then the data (id, name and salary) of
Employees N. There must be no repetition of id.
Then tracked the X percent increase in salary for a given employee.
For this, the program must read an id and the value X. If the informed id does not exist, show a
message and abort the operation. At the end, show the updated list of employees,
as examples.
Remember to apply the encapsulation technique to not allow the salary to be
be transformed freely. A salary can only be increased on the basis of a
percentage increase.
