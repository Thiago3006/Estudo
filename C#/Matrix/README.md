## Proposal 

Make a program to read two integers M and N, and then read
an array of M rows by N columns containing integers,
there may be repetitions. Then read an integer X that
belongs to the headquarters. For each instance of X, show the values to
left, above, right, and below X, if any, as
example

Left: 10

Right: 15

Down: 11

Position 1,3:


Left: 23

Up: 12

Down: 19
